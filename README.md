# Evaluation of Graph Databases
Semester project for ETH ZÃ¼rich. Implemented a benchmark for JanusGraph graph database to compare it with SPCL's GDI implementation for distributed memory RDMA architectures. Benchmark code contains scripts to automate start up of a Cassandra cluster, populating the database instances in the cluster and indexing recently loaded data. 

In this work, we measure and compare the performance of open source graph database management systems, JanusGraph and Neo4j, against Graph Database Interface (GDI) in high performance computing settings, scaling up to thousands of cores and dozens of nodes.
