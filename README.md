# graph_benchmark_evaluation
Semester project for ETH ZÃ¼rich. Implemented a benchmark for JanusGraph graph database to compare it with SPCL's GDI implementation for distributed memory RDMA architectures. Benchmark code contains scripts to automate start up of a Cassandra cluster, populating the database instances in the cluster and indexing recently loaded data.
